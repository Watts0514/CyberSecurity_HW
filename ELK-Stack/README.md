# Automated ELK Stack Deployment
The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the : ( etc/ansible/filebeat-playbook.yml )  file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.


This document contains the following details:

+ Description of the Topology
Access Policies
ELK Configuration

+ Beats in Use
Machines Being Monitored

+ How to Use the Ansible Build


# Description of the Topology
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.
Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly :  safe from DDos attacks by changing the flow of web traffic  , in addition to restricting :  outside access, we can use a remote Virtual Machine to safely log in  to the network.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the : data in the files, for when they may have been changed and system :
+ Metrics & stats, for when you are ready to send them to an output .


The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

# Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.
Machine can accept connections from the Internet. Only the :
+ 5601 Kibana Port


Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses.
Machines within the network can only be accessed by :
+ my IP 73.54.240.243.



| Name          | Publicly Accessible   | Allowed IP Accessible      |
| ------------- |:---------------------:| --------------------------:|
| Jump Box      | Yes/No                | 73.54.240.243              |
| Web1          | No                    | 10.0.0.6 / 40.88.139.89    |
| Web2          | No                    | 10.0.0.7 / 40.88.139.89    |
| ELK-Vnet      | No                    | 10.1.0.0/16 / 40.88.139.89 |




# Elk Configuration

![ELK diagram drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82239563/132780772-e487077a-7642-4f01-ae68-b8d9709f114d.png)


Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
+ you can put commands into multiple servers from a single playbook

The playbook implements the following tasks:

+ Install Docker, then update/upgrade
+ Install pip 3 / and Python
+ Attach Image, for your container
+ Run the Docker container with ELK

The following screenshot displays the result of running docker ps after successfully configuring the ELK instance.


Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
+ Web1, 10.0.0.6 / Web2, 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
+ Microbeats


These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

+ Filebeat monitors the log files, collects events, then sends them to be indexed, Elasticsearch or Logstash.
+ Metricbeat monitors collected metrics/stats then sends them to an output, Elasticsearch or Logstash.


# Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:
SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

Copy the _____ file to _____.
Update the _____ file to include...
Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.


Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?

(https://github.com/Watts0514/CyberSecurity_HW/tree/main/Ansible/filebeat-playbook.yml)

https://github.com/Watts0514/CyberSecurity_HW/tree/main/Ansible/metricbeat-playbook.yml
+ [/etc/ansible/filebeat-config.yml]
Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
+ the /etc/ansible/host file,  then include the Web/ELK server IP's
Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
+ [http://20.94.254.87:5601] Kibana
